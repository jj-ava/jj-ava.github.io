    <p class="textBox">One of the best things that I’ve learned from this computer science class is how much coding connects to my future goals. I’ve always dreamed of becoming an astrophysicist, and this class has shown me that coding is going to be a huge part of that field. I know that I am going to need to have a solid grasp on math and variables, especially how they are used in coding, when going into an astrophysics career. Before this class, I hadn’t had much exposure to computer science, but now I feel like I’ve been introduced to the language of technology, and I love it. I really enjoy coding and using my brain. Writing code challenges me to think logically, organize my thoughts, and solve problems in creative ways. I thought I was going to be bored without any work to do this summer, but I surprised myself. Challenging myself to complete an entire class in 8 weeks was the right move. It brought me excitement to learn more every day and kept me engaged. One area I’m still working on is memorizing all the specific structures of code, especially when switching between different programming languages and tasks (websites vs apps vs games). Sometimes I still need to refer back to notes or examples to remember the exact format for a function or a conditional. However, I know that this can be solved by simply working at it; Memorization is a task that takes time, but I have patience. Overall, this class helped me discover a passion I didn’t even know I had. It gave me a foundation in computer science that I know will support my future studies in physics and astronomy. I’m excited to keep learning and coding towards my dreams!
