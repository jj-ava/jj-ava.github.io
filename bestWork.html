    <p class="textBox">My Unit 2 website project, specifically the gallery page, is the best example of my work because it shows how I combined everything I learned about HTML and CSS to seamlessly create something that not only was functional, but also aesthetically pleasing. Iâ€™m especially proud of this page because it was beyond just writing lines of code to make something show up on my screen; it was about sharing something that means a lot to me, my horses. I think the gallery page stands out because of how visually clean and balanced it is. I used different CSS classes like .rowOne, .single, and .bottom to specify how my layout was going to look. Each class had its own styling to control the image size and spacing to ensure it fit where I wanted it to go. I also took the time to carefully select images that would look good together on a page while also showing off my equestrian accomplishments (I have way too many photos of my horses). I also added border-radius and box-shadow to make the images have a small grey blur around them, giving them a sleek and professional vibe. While most of this came easily once I got the hang of HTML structure, a lot of the positioning for the images involved trial and error. I had to go back and individually adjust the sizing of each image until it was just right for my standards. It was hard to get the layout to look consistent with different photos, as some are vertical and others are landscape. However, after adjusting many times, I got them to look perfect! This project shows the range of skills I developed to write clean HTML and use multiple CSS classes to style different images. It shows my technical skills in understanding difficult topics and highlights my creativity in creating a website that I feel very proud to share.
