    <p class="textBox">One piece of work that represents my growth is my Unit 3 game project. At the beginning of this course, I had no experience with coding or computer science. I didn’t know how to create a variable, what a function was, or how to control anything on screen. But after just a few weeks, I’ve built a full game with a player, enemies, obstacles, and lives. The game I made is a maze where the player controls a dog trying to reach a bone while avoiding two moving cats. If the dog touches a cat, it loses a life and restarts at the beginning. If the dog loses all three lives, the game ends and displays a "You lost all your lives..." message. But if the dog reaches the bone, the game congratulates the player with a "You got the bone!" message. I used createSprite() and setAnimation() to add characters, and I used custom functions like playerControls(), checkCollisions(), and getBone() to manage gameplay. One of the hardest areas to master was simply memorizing all the different blocks of code and what they do. For example, I had to learn how isTouching() works to detect when the dog reaches the bone or hits a cat. I also had to figure out how to make the cats move back and forth using velocityX and reverse their direction when they reached the edge of their path. It helped that there were a lot of resources for me to use and look back at to help remember what kind of code to use. My level of effort made a big difference in how successful I was when creating my game project. I try to finish the week's assignments early so I can focus on the project. I gave myself enough time to try things out and fix bugs, and that helped me stay calm and be a good problem solver. If I could go back, I would add even more features to make my game more advanced, like different levels, complex movements for the cats, or even sound effects when you lose a life or win the game. For now, I’m really proud of what I built. I went from not knowing how to write a single line of code to making something that’s actually fun to play, showing just how much I’ve grown.
