    <p class="textBox">Hello! My name is Ava Jaggars. Some of my biggest interests are science, space, and horses. I’m an equestrian who competes in hunters and equitation, and I also hope to become an astrophysicist someday. Outside of school, I enjoy photography, coffee, and travelling around the world.

    This portfolio is a collection of the projects I’ve worked on during my computer science class this summer. It highlights the progress I’ve made and the skills I’ve learned over the course. When I started in June, I had no experience with coding. Now, just a couple of weeks later, I’ve created a working maze game, a BuzzFeed-style quiz app, and even designed my own website from a blank page.

    Throughout the class, I’ve learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve gone from struggling to remember how the user can interact with an app to writing full projects that I’m really proud of. This class introduced me to a new side of technology, and I found out that I really enjoy computer science and problem-solving through code.
