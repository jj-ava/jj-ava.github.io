    <p class="fancy">I edited the embed code by adding a title and changing the size. Now it fits in my screen perfectly. I chose the Unit 3 Game project because I am very proud of creating it. It took a lot of effort to get right, and I am happy with the result. It may be my favorite Unit Project during this entire class.</p>
